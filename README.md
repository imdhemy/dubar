# Dubar
Dubar is the e-version of flashcards. Flashcards are one of the classic study tools, and for good reason, they promote studying through [active recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall). Active recall is a principle
  of efficient learning, which claims the need to actively stimulate memory during the learning process.

Dubar [دُبار](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AF%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1_(%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85)) is an Arabic word that means Wednesday. So I'm more or less intended to name my projects after Arabic names that may appear as special words for non-Arabic people. My first baby Mohaia was born Wednesday, Dec 09, 2020
 , and that is the reason behind naming this software "Dubar" / Wednesday.
